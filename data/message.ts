I found something pretty today and it made me think of you — soft, bright, and impossible not to smile at. I wanted to celebrate you — your kindness, your laugh, the way you brighten my days.

You're my queen of small things and big heart. Happy National Princess Day. 🌸

— With all my love, Rushi`,
